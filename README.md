### G'Day üëã

<link rel="me" href="https://mstdn.social/@alecthegeek">

I'm Alec, an Australian/British computer geek, who's been in IT a long time.
I've done many IT related jobs, and even been a manager for a while before running back to technology as
a [developer advocate](https://emilyfreeman.io/blog/developer-relations-more-than-the-art-of-talking-good).

These days I am semi retired and support the seniors in my community with their IT needs (mainly cyber security).

- üòÑ Pronouns: He/Him/Grumpy

<!-- - Currently writing a talk on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) -->

- :computer: First Computer Program written on ICL 2904 mainframe in 1978 using [MAXIMOP](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res59.htm#g) BASIC. No "Hello World" for me, it printed the multiplication tabels from 2 to 12, but I only knew about IF and GOTO flow control statements.
